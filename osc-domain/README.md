# OSC Domain

The **osc-domain** project contains all database entities that represents the OSC business model. This project functions as a thin data access layer and, as such, should not contain any business logic.

### Dependencies
It is not expected for this project to have direct dependencies on other **osc-core** projects besides [**osc-common**](../osc-common).
