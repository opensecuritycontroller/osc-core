Open Security Controller (OSC) is a software-defined security orchestration solution that automates deployment of virtualized network security functions, like next-generation firewall, intrusion prevention systems, and application data controllers. OSC enables East-West data center security, is scalable, and reduces threats in software defined network environments.

OSC simplifies and automates security management and compliance and because it is open, offers organizations the flexibility to choose the security technology that is best suited to their needs.

   > Note: The individual projects within **osc-core** contain documentation describing the project as well as the project dependencies. When changing dependencies on the **osc-core** projects, ensure to comply with OSGi best practices to avoid dependency fanout.
