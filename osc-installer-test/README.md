# OSC Installer Test

This project tests the installation of OSC as an OSGi container and utilizes the [PaxExam](https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/PAXEXAM4/Pax+Exam ) framework. Because this test is an integration test rather than a unit test, it must be in a separate project. 

### Dependencies
This project depends on [**osc-installer**](../osc-installer) and [**osc-resolver**](../osc-resolver).
