# OSC Resolver

The **osc-resolver** project is part of the management of OSC plugins plumbing together three [OSGi specifications](https://www.osgi.org/developer/specifications/): the OSGi resolver service, the OSGi repository service, and the OSGi framework wiring API.

### Dependencies
This project is expected to not have direct dependencies with other **osc-core** projects but does interface with other OSGi dependencies.
