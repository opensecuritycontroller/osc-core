# OSC Installer

The **osc-installer** project is used to manage OSC plugins.

This project works with **[osc-resolver](../osc-resolver)** and **[osc-simple-installer](../osc-installer-simple)** to make OSGi services implemented by the plugins available to OSC upon installation.

### Dependencies
This project has a direct dependency with only [**osc-resolver**](../osc-installer-simple) used to validate plugin BAR files.
